‚úÖ Assumptions Made
Only unique usernames can register (enforced by additional validation).

Posts can only be created, updated, or deleted by authenticated users.

JWT is used to securely verify and authorize user actions.

Post data includes a reference to the user who created it.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
Restricting Duplicate Users:
Initially, the same username could register multiple times. This was fixed by checking for existing usernames before registration.

Post Ownership Security:
A major challenge was restricting users from creating or modifying posts using another user's ID. This was resolved by extracting the authenticated user‚Äôs ID from the JWT and comparing it to the post‚Äôs user field during protected routes like PUT and DELETE but still cant solve that of the creating post.
